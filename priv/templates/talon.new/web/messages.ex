  Application facing messages generated by the Talon application.

  This module was created by the talon.new mix task. It contains all the
  messages used in the coherence application except those in other generated
  files like the view and templates.

  To assist in upgrading Talon, the `Talon.Messages behaviour will
  alway contain every message for the current version.  This will help in upgrades
  to ensure the user had added new the new messages from the current version.
